invisibleCapture is a lightweight application designed to silently monitor clipboard activity and keyboard input in the background. It operates discreetly, capturing clipboard contents and keystrokes without interrupting the user's workflow. All captured data is logged into a file named "output.txt" located in the same directory as the application itself. invisibleCapture is intended for use cases where discreet monitoring of user activity is necessary, such as debugging, user behavior analysis, or parental control applications. Its minimalistic design and unobtrusive operation make it suitable for various scenarios where stealthy monitoring is required.
